          Jupiter's Cloud Tops: From High to Low
        </h1>

          A view from NASA's Juno spacecraft.

        This view from NASA's Juno spacecraft captures colorful, intricate
        patterns in a jet stream region of Jupiter's northern hemisphere known
        as "Jet N3". Jupiter's cloud tops do not form a simple, flat surface.
        Data from Juno helped scientists discover that the swirling bands in the
        atmosphere extend deep into the planet, to a depth of about 1,900 miles
        (3,000 kilometers). At center right, a patch of bright, high-altitude
        "pop-up" clouds rises above the surrounding atmosphere.

        Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia
        and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in
        Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language
        ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it
        with the necessary regelialia.
      </p>

      <h2>In a paradisematic country</h2>

      <p>
        It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly
        into your mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the
        blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small
        line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the
        far World of Grammar.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of
        bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little
        Blind Text didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial
        into the belt and made herself on the way.
      </p>

      <p>
        When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last
        view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of
        Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful
        a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way. On
        her way she met a copy.
      </p>

      <h2>The Copy Warning</h2>

      <p>
        The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would
        have been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from
        its origin would be the word "and" and the Little Blind Text should turn
        around and return to its own, safe country. But nothing the copy said
        could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a few insidious Copy
        Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with Longe and Parole and dragged
        her into their agency, where they abused her for their projects again
        and again.
      </p>

      <p>
        And if she hasn’t been rewritten, then they are still using her. Far far
        away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and
        Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in
        Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language
        ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it
        with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which
        roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth. Even the all-powerful
        Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost
        unorthographic life One
